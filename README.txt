Differences: 

We spent a lot of time cleaning the interface to be more presentable.  We also added skeleton functionality for the maps and for the user accounts. We are not totally on track with the app idea paper, but we are making progress and it should be close to completion by the time we need to finish the final release.
We had a lot of merging conflicts and ultimately had to create a new project from scratch to incorporate all of the changes. Hopefully, we can get version control working better before the final release is due.
